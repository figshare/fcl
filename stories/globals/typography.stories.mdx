Typography definitions and style guides. Typography is defined and applied to each appropriate tag through the `styles/index.css` file, which can be imported.
It will expose appropriate css variables for typography definitions as well.

You can import the typography styling in your code:
```jsx
// import only typography variables and styling
import "@figshare/fcl/styles/generic/typography.css";
// or with colors as well
import "@figshare/fcl/styles/index.css";
```
And reference the variables in your css files:

```css
.sizeXXXL {
  font-size: var(--typography-XXXL-fontSize);
  line-height: var(--typography-XXXL-lineHeight);
}

.sizeXXL {
  font-size: var(--typography-XXL-fontSize);
  line-height: var(--typography-XXL-lineHeight);
}

.sizeXL {
  font-size: var(--typography-XL-fontSize);
  line-height: var(--typography-XL-lineHeight);
}

.sizeL {
  font-size: var(--typography-L-fontSize);
  line-height: var(--typography-L-lineHeight);
}

.sizeM {
  font-size: var(--typography-M-fontSize);
  line-height: var(--typography-M-lineHeight);
}

.sizeS {
  font-size: var(--typography-S-fontSize);
  line-height: var(--typography-S-lineHeight);
}

.sizeXS {
  font-size: var(--typography-XS-fontSize);
  line-height: var(--typography-XS-lineHeight);
}
```

        <h1> Yellow sea mediated segregation between North East Asian Dryophytes species </h1>
        <h2> Abstract </h2>
        <p>
        While comparatively few amphibian species have been described on the North East Asian
        mainland in the last decades, several species have been the subject of taxonomical
        debates in relation to the Yellow sea. Here, we sampled Dryophytes sp. treefrogs from
        the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the People’s
        Republic of China to clarify the status of this clade around the Yellow sea and determine
        the impact of sea level change on treefrogs’ phylogenetic relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
        Based on genetics, call properties, adult morphology, tadpole morphology and niche
        modelling, we determined the segregated status species of
        <a href="#1"> D. suweonensis and D. immaculatus</a>.
        We then proceeded to describe a new treefrog species, D. flaviventris sp. nov., from the
        central lowlands of the Republic of Korea.
        </p>
        <h2> Introduction </h2>
        <p>
        Sea level fluctuations in relation to climatic oscillations have consecutively isolated
        and connected populations [1–3]. In some cases, the interval between sea level variations
        resulted in drift and speciation [4], in others, the clades were brought back in contact
        before isolation [5].
        </p>
        <p>
        For instance, <a href="#1">Hylid treefrogs</a> isolated on peninsulas in the Mediterranean
        sea diverged as a result of sea level variations in conjunction with ice ages [6, 7], while
        other species such as green toads (Bufo viridis subgroup) show widespread hybridisation in
        contact zones [8]. In addition, other species display “speciation reversal” following
        hybridisation and reversal into a shared gene-pool [9], such as sticklebacks [10].
        </p>
        <h2> Materials and methods </h2>
        <h3> Field sampling </h3>
        <p>
        Data for the three clades was collected between 2016 and 2019 in the Republic of Korea
        (hereafter R Korea), the <a href="#1">Democratic People’s Republic of Korea</a> (hereafter DPR
        Korea) and the People’s Republic of China (hereafter China; Fig 1).
        </p>
        <p>
        The samples in Paju (R Korea) area were collected in 2013 as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li> D. suweonensis </li>
        <ul>
          <li> D. flaviventris </li>
          <li> D. suweonensis </li>
          <li>
            D. a very long list element lorem iosum dolor est that goes on two lines lorem iosum dolor
            est sit amet consectetur
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li> D. suweonensis </li>
            <li> D. immaculatus </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>
          D. immaculatus a very long list element lorem iosum dolor est that goes on two lines lorem
          iosum dolor est sit amet consectetur
        </li>
        <li> Pyeongtaek </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        To be able to analyse morphometric variations without any bias due to the size of the individuals,
        we adjusted the dataset by dividing each value by the SVL of the individual. This procedure also
        eliminated any bias introduced by alcohol preserved samples. <a href="#1">Variables in the dataset </a>
        were generally correlated (<a href="#1">Pearson’s correlation</a>; n = 55; Table 4) so we used a PCA
        here as well to analyse variations between each of the clades.
        </p>
        <p>
        The samples in Paju (R Korea) area were collected in 2013 as follows:
        </p>

        <h3> Tadpoles reared in captivity </h3>
        <h4> Tadpole morphology </h4>
        <p>
        Next, we looked at <strong>morphological variations</strong> between tadpoles of the three clades
        examined here, with a focus on oral morphology.
        </p>
        <p>
        The data for D. suweonensis arises from five wild caught pairs with tadpoles reared in captivity
        (see [78] for details on rearing protocol) resulting in 100 tadpoles (n = 20 per family) examined
        and photographed for their oral structure.
        </p>
        <h4> Lumenera Corporation </h4>
        <h5> Tadpoles </h5>
        <p>
        The data for D. immaculatus is based on four tadpoles captured in Hefei (32.310°N, 118.583°E) and
        observed under the microscope (Infinity1-1C, Lumenera Corporation; Nepean, Canada), and compared
        to the work presented in Fei [59]. For the comparison between the three clades, we focused on the
        number of upper and lower labial tooth rows and the presence of medial gaps.
        </p>
        <h5> Impact of sea level change on treefrogs’ phylogenetic relationships </h5>
        <h6> Impact of sea level change on treefrogs’ phylogenetic relationships </h6>
        <p>
        The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the People’s Republic of China to clarify the status
        of this clade around the Yellow sea and determine the impact of sea level change on treefrogs’
        phylogenetic relationships.
